This project is to forecast the future trends of bitcoin price using ARIMA model.
I have used "Bitcoin US Dollar" data set which consists of 6 attributes namely: Date, Open, High, Low, Adj Low, Volume.
Of the 6 attributes, "Date" attribute is in date format, whereas everything else is Currency Format.
A excel file has been uploaded on the same.
Steps involved for getting the results are as follows:
Step 1: Visualizing the time series data.
Step 2: Assessing whether the time series is stationary, and if not, how many differences are required to make it stationary.
Step 3: Estimation involves using numerical methods to minimize a loss or error term.
Step 4: To look for evidence that the model is a good fit for the data.
